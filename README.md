The code for analyzing the data is prepared in MySQL, written in Python, and provided in a Jupyter Notebook.

The data used in this analysis was obtained from the IFC Advisory Services Projects database, which contains information about various IFC Advisory Services projects and investments for different sectors and regions around the world.

## Key findings:

Some of the key findings from the data analysis are:

* The continent of Africa was the most favored by the International Finance Corporation’s Advisory Services, for they had bestowed upon it the greatest number of projects (almost a quarter of the total), but their generosity was not matched by their munificence, for they had allotted to each project only an average budget of $1.3 million, which was close to the global average of $1.4 million. Europe and the rest of the world, on the other hand, received fewer projects but larger budgets ($2.9 million and $2.4 million respectively).
* The most magnificent project in terms of budget was the Kenya Kazi Kwa Community Fund (KKCF), which received a princely sum of $25 million, followed by the India Affordable Housing Finance Program (IAHFP), which received a royal sum of $20 million.
* More than half of the projects (53%) were still active and flourishing, while 43% were completed and successful, and only 4% were cancelled or closed for various reasons.
* The years 2019 and 2020 were the most prosperous and fruitful for the International Finance Corporation’s Advisory Services, for they had invested in them the highest total budgets ($191 million and $173 million respectively), while 2008 and 2021 were the most barren and dismal ($16 million and $18 million respectively).
Latin America was the most prompt and diligent in disclosing its projects (164 days on average), while the Middle East Middle East took the longest and was the least productive (379 days on average).
